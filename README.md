## How to Play

- Two players take turns to roll a dice.  
- Each roll adds to the player’s current turn score unless a 1 is rolled, which ends the turn and resets the current score.  
- Players can “Hold” to add their current turn score to their total score.  
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.
